### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ fellow inhabitant of the floating rock we call Earth, my name is Jefferson! 

##### I am a developer experience engineer passionate about emergent web technologies, privacy and secruity, scalability, and performant tooling for reaching the farthest reaches of the internet 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a high-performance, distributed data processing system using Node.js and frameworks like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven communication. I'm focusing on optimizing the system's performance and scalability by implementing techniques such as data partitioning, parallel processing, and distributed caching.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create a secure microservices architecture with advanced security mechanisms. I'm using Node.js and containerization tools like Docker and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. I'm implementing security measures such as Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication, OAuth 2.0 with JWT for authentication and authorization, and API Gateway for centralized security enforcement.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to performance optimization, scalability, security, and cloud deployment in Node.js. I'm interested in working with individuals or teams who share similar interests and have expertise in these areas.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with gaining expertise in DevOps practices and cloud deployment for Node.js applications. I would appreciate assistance with implementing highly available and automated cloud infrastructures, utilizing tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, and setting up CI/CD pipelines for efficient application deployment.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about topics related to high-performance, distributed data processing systems, security practices for Node.js applications, and DevOps and cloud deployment strategies in the context of Node.js development.
